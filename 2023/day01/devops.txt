DevOps is a methodology which Involves practices to bridge the gap of Dev and ops team by using Open source automation build tools.
These are the articles which I refered to,

formal defination   :   "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."

The main goal of DEVOPS is to shorten cycle time. Start with the release pipeline. How long does it take to deploy a change of one line of code or configuration.

DevOps: It is a culture/methodology to bridge the gap between development and operations!

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

In DevOps, development, quality assurance, security, and operations teams work together throughout the entire software development process, from design and development to deployment and operations. This collaboration helps to ensure that software is developed and released quickly, reliably, and securely.

Benefits of DevOps

Faster time to market: DevOps helps to accelerate the software development process by breaking down silos between development and operations teams. This allows for faster feedback loops and more rapid deployment of new features and updates.
Increased software quality: DevOps helps to improve software quality by ensuring that development and operations teams are working together to identify and fix defects early in the development process.
Reduced costs: DevOps can help to reduce costs by automating manual tasks and by eliminating duplication of effort between development and operations teams.
Increased customer satisfaction: DevOps can help to increase customer satisfaction by delivering high-quality software that meets customer needs more quickly.
If you are looking for ways to improve your software development process, DevOps is a great option to consider.

DevOps: A crucial element in the modern software development landscape

In today's fast-paced and competitive world, businesses are constantly striving to deliver high-quality software products at an ever-increasing pace. To achieve this, they are turning to DevOps, a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

The importance of DevOps

DevOps is important for a number of reasons:

Faster time to market: By breaking down the silos between development and operations, DevOps teams can deliver software faster. This is because developers and operations teams are working together throughout the development process, which helps to identify and resolve issues early on.
Increased reliability: DevOps teams use a variety of tools and techniques to automate the testing, deployment, and monitoring of software. This helps to ensure that software is released in a reliable and stable state.
Improved quality: DevOps teams are constantly striving to improve the quality of their software. This is done by using a variety of techniques, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
Reduced costs: DevOps can help to reduce the costs associated with software development and delivery. This is because DevOps teams are able to identify and resolve issues early on, which helps to prevent rework and delays.
Increased customer satisfaction: By delivering high-quality software faster, DevOps can help to increase customer satisfaction. This is because customers are more likely to be satisfied with software that is released on time, is reliable, and meets their needs.
The benefits of DevOps

The benefits of DevOps are numerous and include:

Faster time to market
Increased reliability
Improved quality
Reduced costs
Increased customer satisfaction
Improved employee morale
Reduced risk
Increased innovation
The future of DevOps

DevOps is a rapidly growing field, and there are many opportunities for those with DevOps skills. As businesses continue to adopt DevOps practices, the demand for DevOps professionals is expected to increase.
